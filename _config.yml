  Over the past years, I pursued three simultaneous careers, as (a) an investment manager for Digital Age Fund and Midas Capital, (b) as a technology consultant and (c) as Angel Investor.
  
  During my tenure at Digital Age I returned a MoM of ca ~2.5x in 1.5 years by investing in BTC, BNB and LEO.
  At Midas Capital I was responsible for a team of 5 people, providing liquidity in digital assets exchanges on listed derivatives (swaps and futures).
  
  As technology consultant I worked with BlockchainLab, BitQuota, The Rock Trading and Cydia (iOS marketplace for jailbroken devices). 
  
  As an Angel Investor I carried several investments in early-stage and more established companies such as Bitfinex, The Rock Trading, IONOMR, AlphaFlow. You can see some of them on my profile below.
