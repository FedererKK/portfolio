## About me

Over the past years, I pursued three simultaneous careers, as (a) an investment manager for Digital Age Fund and Midas Capital, (b) as a technology consultant and (c) as an Angel Investor.
  
  During my tenure at Digital Age I returned ~2.5x in 1.5 years by investing in cryptocurrencies.
  At Midas Capital I was responsible for a team of 5 people, providing liquidity in digital assets listed derivatives (swaps, futures and options).
  
  As technology consultant I worked with BlockchainLab, BitQuota, Medisieve, Sygnum, The Rock Trading and Cydia. 
  
  As an Angel Investor I carried several investments in early-stage and more established companies such as Bitfinex, The Rock Trading, IONOMR, AlphaFlow and Kraken.
  
  I am skilled in Portfolio Management, Market-microstructure, Systematic Trading, Derivatives, and Alternative Investments. I am a perpetual learner, interested in quantitative finance, technology and philosophy. My programming languages of choice are Python and R. I hold a MSc in Analytics and Management from London Business School and a BSc in International Economics and Finance from Bocconi University.
